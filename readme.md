About
================================================================================

The `puppetapt` module adds the Puppet Labs puppet apt repositories
([http://apt.puppetlabs.com/](http://apt.puppetlabs.com/)) to the apt sources
list.

This adds versions of puppet packages like `puppet`, `puppetmaster`, and
`puppetdb` amongst others.
